# Check box race extension
It's like a cheat... but shhh

I would not harm in any kind of the creator of checkboxrace.com as I think it is a really simple but interesting game so this project is doesn't meant to be againist this


## Then why is this extension?

Just for fun! I just wanted a little project to have and to make a little progression in browser extensions ðŸ˜…


## How to install?

Download the source code of this project, extract to a folder and then install manually. (Don't know how to do it? <a href="https://ourtechroom.com/tech/manually-locally-install-chrome-extension/">Here is a nice guide: just click!</a>)


I don't know if I should publish this into the Chrome Webstore as it's just a little project but maybe I will... That's the music of the future!

### Where is this working?

Everywhere where you have to click 100 checkboxes but mainly it works on <a href="https://checkboxrace.com/">Checkboxrace.com</a> and supports <a href="https://its-a-mia.github.io/SunsetSurfer/">Its-A-Mia's project</a> too (as it is based on the original one)

Btw I would like to make a project like this site (check 100 box which are moving frustating everywhere) so check my profile sometimes!
